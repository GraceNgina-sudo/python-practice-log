##Topics covered: Python data types 
-Variables in python
-Swapping variables
-Understanding 'Id()' function in python
-Understanding the 'type()' function in python
-Introduction to lists in python

##Summary:
-Variables are containers used to store data values. In Python, variables do not need to be declared with a specific type, as Python is dynamically typed.
-The 'id()' function returns the identity of an object, which is unique and constant for the object during its lifetime.
-The 'type()' function returns the type of an object, which can be useful for debugging and understanding the data types being used in a program.
-Lists are a built-in data type in Python that can store multiple items in a single variable. Lists are ordered, changeable, and allow duplicate values. They are defined using square brackets [] and can contain items of different data types.

##Challenges:
-None at this time.
