##Topics covered: Exercises
-Swapping variables
Given two variables, a and b, You need to swap their values so that a holds the value of b and b holds the value of a.
a = 5
b = 10
a, b = b, a
print("After swapping: a =", a, ", b =", b)
-Test if tuple is distinct
Given a tuple, arr you need to print True if all the elements in the tuple are distinct, otherwise print False.
arr = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
print("Is tuple distinct?", len(arr) == len(set(arr)))
-Find index of an element in a tuple
Given a tuple, arr with distinct elements and an integer x. Find the position of x. Assume to have x in the tuple always print the index (o-based)
arr = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
x = 3
print("Index of", x, "in tuple:", arr.index(x))
-Implement set in python
add element i
remove element r
print the sum of all elements in the set
st = [6, 7, 81, 2, 1], i =3 r = 6

 st = {int(x) for x in input().split()}
 i = int(input())
  r = int(input())
  # Add element i
  st.add(i)
  #printing the set
  for i in sorted (st):
    print(i, end=" ")
    print()
  # Remove element r
  st.remove(r)
  #printing the set
  for i in sorted (st):
    print(i, end=" ")
    print()
  # Print the sum of all elements in the set
  s = sum(st)
  print(s)
