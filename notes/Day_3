##Topics covered: Data types in python
-Tuples in python
-Sets in python
-Dictionaries in python
-Type conversion in python

##Summary:
# -Tuples are similar to lists but are immutable, meaning they cannot be changed after creation. They are defined using parentheses () and can contain items of different data types.
# -Sets are unordered collections of unique items. They are defined using curly braces {} and can be used to perform mathematical set operations like union, intersection, and difference.
# -Dictionaries are collections of key-value pairs. They are defined using curly braces {} and can be used to store data in a structured way. Keys must be unique and immutable, while values can be of any data type.
# -Type conversion is the process of converting one data type to another. Python provides built-in functions like int(), float(), str(), list(), tuple(), set(), and dict() for type conversion.

##Challenges:
# -None at this time.
